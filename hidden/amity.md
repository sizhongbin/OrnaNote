# Amity

> Last Update: 31 Oct, 2023

## General Info

- Amity seeds depend on 3 things: Party, Hour and the final node Q&A.
- The seed is what determines the Amity bonus + malus.
- Rarity generally changes the maluses - the main bonus will always remain.
- Rarity is rolled for each individual hunt, but the same rarity will have all the same bonuses + maluses for the seed (people will receive the same legendary or ornate Amity).
- Some bonuses + maluses are not available to all tiers, so different tiers usually get different Amities from the same seed.
- Seed hour blocks repeat every 24 hours on UTC - so the same seed repeats every day at the same hour until weekly rotation.
- Seeds last weekly and rotate at the same time as dungeons (00:00 UTC).
- IRL location doesn't matter as long as the above conditions are met!
- You can start a memory hunt and complete 3/5 memories before joining a party to receive the same seed at the final node Q&A. You must complete the 4th memory hunt in the correct party to generate the same seeded final nodes.
- When hunting Amities, to always be in a party is recommended! If you're not in a party and find a good Amity you want to share, when you invite people it will create a new party and change the seed.
