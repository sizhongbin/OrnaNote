## SzHb's Notes

1. Theta Riftlocks are from Shades and Shadows in Riftfall event, can be used to craft Scroll of (Arisen) Rift Distortion.
2. **[Heretic]** Get Ornate ***T10*** Arisen Rift Cowl from Arisen Rift Judgement, an Achlys head for mages.
3. **[Gilgamesh]** Get Ornate ***T10*** Arisen Rift Chestplate from Arisen Rift Judgement, a mix of Achlys and Rhada chestplate.
4. Get Ornate ***T10*** Arisen Rift Armor from Arisen Rift Judgement if you need, a good piece with high ward + HP / Mana recovery.
