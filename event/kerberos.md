## SzHb's Notes

1. **[Heretic]** Get ***T10*** Arisen Feral Archistaff from Arisen Kerberos, a solid mage weapon that provides good Mag and 7% follower act.
2. Get ***T10*** Arisen Wolven Tower Shield from Arisen Kerberosa if you prefer high Def/Res and don't care much about the Att/Mag penalty.
3. Get at least 5 superior or higher ***T9*** Blackened Eye of Kerberos from Kin of Kerberos (with Godforged Aura), a 2% follower act weapon adorn, plus foresight and 2% ward and bonus stats.
4. Get superior or higher ***T5*** Dark Eye of Kerberos from Kin of Kerberos (without Godforged Aura) instead of blackened eyes if your tier is lower than T9.
5. Get Ornate ***T10*** Beastfelled Garb if you need, a thief chestpiece that gives your pet the ability to use Berserk.
6. Get Ornate ***T10*** Beastfelled Legwear if you need. All pants allow your pet to use Ward of Ortanite.
