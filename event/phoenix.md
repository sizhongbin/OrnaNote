## SzHb's Notes

1. Get Ornate ***T9*** Great Phoenician Shield from ***T9*** Arisen Phoenix that provides immunity to burn and blind.
2. Get some ***T5*** Red Pinion (superior or better) from event raids, armor adorn that give 2% ward and some stats.
3. Get some ***T5*** Ruby / ***T9*** Ashen Ruby from event bosses, weapon adorns that have 50% chance to recover 1% / 2% of damage dealt PER ADORN.
4. Get ***T8*** Phoenix / ***T10*** Ashen phpenix pet for Deific Channel without cast turns.
5. All gears from mobs and bosses can be dismantled for silk, which is hard to get normally.
