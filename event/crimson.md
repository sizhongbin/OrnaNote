# The Crimson Festival

> Last Update: 20 Nov, 2023

## SzHb's Notes

1. 1 quest. 
2. Get some ***T9*** Ferocious Bull's Eye from ***T9*** Ferocious Cerus, a weapon adornment which gives 12 att + 12 mag + 60 mana + 4% crit.
3. Get some ***T9*** Gorgon's Eye from ***T9*** Noble Perseus, a weapon adornment which gives 4% crit + 3% status protection, but -30 mana.
4. For summoners, get a ***T9*** Goat's Hood (any quality) from ***T9*** Tricky Aries, which -600 foresight that will make you act after your party member when you need to.
5. For realms and gilgaU, get high quality ***T9*** Serpentslayer's chest and leg from ***T9*** Untarnished Perseus. They both give 400 mana, 20 att and 2% stats protection, which are good for horde sweep build. (My head was eaten by Mightiest Mimic so i don't need the head piece)
6. All Perseus gears can be dismantled for ancient stone, which is hard to get normally.
