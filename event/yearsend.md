# Stop Scruug!

## What's new in 2023

1. Event name changed.
2. Mobs and Bosses can be found in Regular Dungeon rather than Goblin Fortress.

## SzHb's Notes

1. Get ***T5*** / ***T9*** / ***T10*** Jolly Stockings (any quality) from Raids, which is the only leg piece with luck bonus (1.725x when Godforged).
2. Get high quality ***T10*** Scrugg weapons only if you don't want to use Jolly Stockings / Unfelled Concord + Dowsing Rod for full luck bonus. (My head was eaten by Mightiest Mimic so a 1.875x is automatically calculated)
3. For Heretic, get high quality ***T10*** Arisen North Star for Mana Burn II, which can burn your mana quickly for higher Iconoclast stats bonus.
4. Get some Stranger's Gifts from event mobs and bosses. Open them on Christmas Day with Alfar Trinket.
