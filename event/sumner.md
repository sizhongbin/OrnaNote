# Paths of Fomoria - House of Sumner

> Last Update: 2 July, 2024

## SzHb's Notes

1. Gears from different house have different specific effect.
- Nocturna: Less damage from opponents' followers/summons.
- Autumna: Better debuff application. More debuff damage on opponents.
- Sumner: More AoE damage. Sometimes single target skills will hit a second target.
- Wintara: Buffs sometimes also apply to party mates. Positive status effects last longer.
2. All gears from House of Sumner event bosses except the ones summoned by crest have Sumner effect. All gears from Paths of Fomoria event bosses summoned by crest have all weakened house effects.
3. Get Summon Buggane if you are summoner (attuner) classline.
