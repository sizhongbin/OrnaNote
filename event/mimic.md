# The Mimics are Loose!

> Last Update: 2 July, 2024

## SzHb's Notes
1. Get ***T10*** The Mightiest Mimic pet, 100% turn 1 Mimic's Mischief. More useful if you are using gears that gives your follower buff skills.
2. Get Ornate ***T10*** Carl's Ring (mimic), maybe the best stat boosting accessory.
3. Get some Vulcan's Brew, a consumable that increases gold, orns, and XP by 20% for an hour.
4. Get Ornate ***T9*** Fey Yeti Coat, a good chest piece for all classes.
5. Get Normal ***T9*** Mightiest Mimic Head**, like the Mighty Mimic head with no negative stats and a very small boost to XP.
6. Check the drop list of raids and get whatever you need.
