○ T10 - Finesse (<https://tinyurl.com/ornafinesse>)
*(The links lead to images of completed codex entries.)*

⚔️ **__Items of Interest__** ⚔️
○ **Arisen Arch-Gadget** - the best defensive stat debuff protection accessory, prevents every type of Def and Res down
○ **Arisen Contraption** - a fairly decent 2% ward adorn (Superior+, as usual)
○ **Arisen Avalon Gear** - some really nice ward gear for warriors
○ **Weapons from Finesse** - some pretty solid picks if you're still hunting for a good weapon! Most have ward or crit.

📘 **__Notes__** 📘 
○ For the pets in this event, nothing is all-too noteworthy. **Hengreon**, though, is a melee user's** improvement on Pale Dragon**. Not only does it have Dispel and Miracle, but it's Onslaught can proc Def ⬇️⬇️, which is devastating for unexpecting foes.
○ I highly suggest picking up just one Arisen Arch-Gadget, it'll outplay anything else like the Ring of Day, and it's defensive stats are nothing to scoff at.
○ The Avalon gear from Finesse / Arisen Balin is Tier 9!** If you're Tier 9, and can hit Arisen Balin well, you can get his drops!** These are useful even in Tier 10. 
○ These raids are also among the easiest to codex. None have any annoying status immunities (petrify), any elemental interactions, or any difficult drops. **Usually, just a 100% damage run or two will get you every drop.** If you're going to codex raids, give these a shot!

This event is a bit more of a breather. Take it slow, and enjoy the weather if you can! Do some amity hunting, or rush 250! As per usual, anything you think I missed, covered incorrectly, or put in the wrong spot, please ping me. Have fun folks :)


☀️ **__ Summer Solstice - June 2023 Event Checklist__** 🌙
The Summer Solstice is one of two of these events that happen every year. During this small period of time, the two royals of the rivaling tribes can now be seen - Ljosalfar and Dokkalfar. The King of Ljosalfar is a Tier 5 raid, while the Queen of Dokkalfar is a Tier 8 boss. One may still find Queen of Dokkalfar around the world while travelling if lucky. For codexers, this Queen is arguably one of the more sought-after entries, since she can only be found reliably a handful of days in the year.

☀️ **__Raids__** 🌙
○ T5 - King of Ljosalfar (<https://tinyurl.com/ornakingljo>)

☀️ **__Bosses__** 🌙
○ T8 - Queen of Dokkalfar (<https://tinyurl.com/ornaqueendokk>)

☀️ **__SOME Items of Interest__** 🌙
○ ** Ring of Day** - a very useful accessory that prevents almost every defense and resistance debuff, including temporary buffs (if you know the one that it doesn't protect, you're pretty knowledgeable!)
○ **Cracked Mirror** - arguably a joke item, grab it for the memes
○ **Ring of Night** - think Ring of Day, but for attack and magic debuffs! Easily outclassed by stuff like Old Nothren Crown, though.
○ **Dusk Boots** - a great swash piece at Broken or Poor, sports some useful immunities 

📘 **__Notes__** 📘
○ The King of Ljosalfar is a relatively easy codex entry - if you're used to codexing raids, then this shouldn't be a problem. Queen of Dokkalfar, however, is a boss with a Petrify immunity, so plan accordingly - bring your **Gargoyle** or other petrifying pets.
○ It's advised to pick up a Ring of Day, if you don't already have the better version from this month (Arisen Arch-Gadget). It is really useful in preventing the Resistance and Defense debuffs from the Druid skills.


<:merlin:835445118986616873> **__ Merlin - June 2023 Event Checklist__** <:merlin:835445118986616873>
Merlin has been around since the beginnings of Orna, and this is his eighth time showing himself here, which puts him at the top of the appearances leaderboard. He, as advertised, has drops for every tier beyond 5, so it's advised to at least tap him. However, this seemingly accommodating raid boss used to be a nightmare for codexers. His multi-elemental attacks during his brief appearance in August 2021 had an incredibly low use rate, around 1 in 10000. Lucky for us, today, he is more forgiving.

(`K`ingdom Raid, `W`orld Raid, or `O`ther Means)
○ `K  ` T6 - Fallen Merlin (<https://tinyurl.com/ornafallenmerlin>)
○ `K  ` T9 - Arisen Merlin (<https://tinyurl.com/ornaarisenmerlin>)
*These links, like usual, lead to completed codex entries of Merlin.*

<:merlin:835445118986616873> **__Pets__** <:merlin:835445118986616873>
○ T6 - Archimedes

<:merlin:835445118986616873> **__Items of Interest__** <:merlin:835445118986616873>
○ T? - **Any Tier Myrddin Shield** - these are very high foresight offhands, worth a nab.
○ T? - **Myrddin Gear** - Everything has a decent amount of foresight! If you're looking to move quicker, grab 'em.

📘 **__Notes__** 📘
○ **The boss has plenty of drops, so be sure to get them all.** Even though they seem long and arduous, all should be able to be gotten with 100% damage once or twice, since they are mostly blue rarity.
○ Don't forget, Merlin has some sizable status immunities, including multiple stat immunities. Use **Heretic Jewels, Banshee pet, and Outwill to get the stat immunities you need.**
○ For everyone else, be sure to pick up a decent shield if you plan to party play! Good luck!
○ Grab yourself Archimedes! He only costs gold and can cast Great Meditation for you!
