(Obtain these items from a `S`uper Raid, `R`aid, `B`oss, `M`onster, or `Q`uestline)
○ `R` T9 - **Arisen Arch-Gadget** - the best defensive stat debuff protection accessory, prevents every type of Def and Res down
○ `R` T9 - **Arisen Contraption** - a fairly decent 2% ward adorn (Superior+, as usual)
○ `R` T9 - **Arisen Avalon Gear** - some really nice ward gear for warriors
○ `R` T10 - **Weapons from Finesse** - some pretty solid picks if you're still hunting for a good weapon! Most have ward or crit.
● `S` T10 - **Windtamer Shoes** - a great well-rounded piece of the gear for the leg slot. Has good stats and follower act.
● `S` T10 - **Windtamer Shield/Lance** - have a great offhand ability that is a really nice chain skill

📘 **__Notes__** 📘 
○ For the pets in this event, nothing is all-too noteworthy. **Hengreon**, though, is a melee user's** improvement on Pale Dragon**. Not only does it have Dispel and Miracle, but it's Onslaught can proc Def ⬇️⬇️, which is devastating for unexpecting foes. The new Steward Gwyllgi looks pretty nice for valhallan classes, though.
○ In order to get the new pets, you must obtain parts of the Hippogriff by killing the monsters to trade in for a steward candle <:broccoli_candle:1250613277117911081>. (Use the Monument Guild!) 
○ I highly suggest picking up just one Arisen Arch-Gadget, it'll outplay anything else like the Ring of Day, and it's defensive stats are nothing to scoff at.
○ The Avalon gear from Finesse / Arisen Balin is Tier 9!** If you're Tier 9, and can hit Arisen Balin well, you can get his drops!** These are useful even in Tier 10. 
○ These kingdom raids are also among the easiest to codex. None have any annoying status immunities (petrify), any elemental interactions, or any difficult drops. **Usually, just a 100% damage run or two will get you every drop.** If you're going to codex raids, give these a shot!
○ **Keep an eye out when raiding Balin or Finesse.** If they say "x is waiting...", don't attack them that next turn. This might be Parry or Coup De Grace. If you see it a second time, then it's Coup de Grace and you can attack freely.

..bout time!
