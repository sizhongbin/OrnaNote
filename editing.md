â—‹ **Ferocious Bull's Eye** - 4% crit in just one adorn and some stats?!?!
â—‹ **Gorgon's Eye** - 4% crit in just one adorn and some status immunity?!?!
â—‹ **Poison Arrows** - T10 offhand with ward and a new Poison Volley!

ðŸ“˜ **__Notes__** ðŸ“˜
â—‹ To those trying to summon Ferocious Cerus, regular summoning scrolls won't work. DO NOT USE REGULAR SUMMONING SCROLLS TO SPAWN CERUS!
â—‹ In order to summon the raids in the world, you'll need to craft Crimson Summoning Scrolls. This can be done in a **Herbalist** (remember those?) by combining a regular Summoning Scroll and 10 of an essence. Essence is dropped by the monsters, which can be found in dungeons and in the world.
â—‹ This crafting method will only be present as long as the Crimson Festival. That being said, the scrolls (should) still work after the month ends, you just won't be able to craft more.
â—‹ To codex the monsters, you'll need to be... very patient. They have **Cursed Glare**, which is Fey Gazer's ultimate ability. As such, it has a low proc rate. Trust me, it'll use it.

**TLDR:** Here to learn about how the event works? Read ðŸ“˜ **__Notes__** ðŸ“˜ and then look at the rest.

The warlock Trevelyan has returned! When first announced in 2021, his event also saw the inclusion of two new bosses, Fallen King Meliodas and Arisen King Meliodas, with the latter being later introduced into the game. Both the raids AND bosses introduced a new mechanic - Mark & Execution. When an enemy uses the move Lyon's Mark, you'll receive a Lyon's Mark status effect, which can go away after some time or be cured immediately using Lyon's Penance, a curative. If you have Lyon's Mark, and an enemy uses Lyon's Execution, you will suffer massive damage. It's good practice to either have strong defensive buffs up or use a Penance when necessary, since these will typically end a battle if you're not prepared!

â—‹ T6 - **Trevelyan's Charm** - gives a 10% stat boost when wielding a two-handed weapon.
â—‹ T9 - **Arisen Trevelyan's Charm** - gives a 15% stat boost when wielding a two-handed weapon.

ðŸ“˜ **__Notes__** ðŸ“˜ 
â—‹ When codexing, these two bosses are immune to single and double Res debuffs, as well as T. Res single debuff. Use **Outwill** for single Res down, a **Banshee** pet for double Res down, and a **Heretic's Jewel** or any **Swordplay** for T. Res down.
â—‹ The Trevelyan Charms aren't outmatched by much for people who use two-handed weapons. It is advised, even if you don't run two-handed weapons, to pick up at least **2 Arisen Trevelyan's Charms** to use whenever you need them.
â—‹ If you're T9 or above, you'll be able to find Lyon's Penance from Arisen King Meliodas in Battlegrounds.
