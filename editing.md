🍄 **__Items of Interest__** 🍄

○ **Sour & Smelly Mushrooms** - One is berserk, one procs offensive stat buffs!
○ **Naggeneen's Shoes** - among the best shoes for people in Tier 8.
○ **Clurichaun Offhands** - these give solid boosts to gold! 
○ **Bricriu's Bow (T6) & Amadan's Staff (T8)** - both give AoE skills!

📘 **__Notes__** 📘
○ While the raids have many status immunities (including a **Petrify** immunity, so bring a **Gargoyle**), the mobs and boss have none! **Just get their moves and their drop once**. These 9 are easy codex entries.
○ Both Naggeneen have 4 elemental resistances/immunities, which are **Water, Lightning, Holy, and Earthen**. 
○ Pack yourself some **Toxic immunity**, or a way to clear it when you get it. Thanks to things like **Briny Pendant** from the Kraken, though, it's easier to manage.
○ Stock up on those consumables! **Smelly Mushroom can proc a Berserk III effect**, and both are great if you're looking to speedrun things.

<:tmk:1214020897627705434> **__SOME Items of Interest__** <:tmk:1214020897627705434>
(Obtain these items from a `S`uper Raid, `R`aid,  `B`oss, `M`onster, or `Q`uestline)
● `R` T10 - **Arisen Aaru Leggings** - a really nice bulky warrior piece that boasts a sizable ward boost.
● `R` T10 - **Arisen Aaru Robe** - a mage piece that gives your follower Great Meditation!
● `S` T10 - **[Magewear] of Dynasty** - gives you access to "Gods of Aaru", which is a 2 turn DC!
● `S` T10 - **[Warriorwear] of Dynasty** - gives you access to "Walls of Aaru", which is a 2 turn DB!
● `Q` T8 - **Tail of a Sphinx** - increases the chance of getting an ornate item!

📘 **__Notes__** 📘
○ When codexing the Thronemaker raids, all you need to do is **pack Sleep Dart, Stun Dart, and Great Mimic's Mischief**. These will get you all 10 status immunities that the raids have. Use Sleep Dart until it procs, then use Stun Dart until it procs, then keep spamming GMM and checking the codex until all 10 are populated. This shouldn't take too long, but keep a close eye on yourself to make sure you're not dying from your own DoTs.
○ You can earn Old Seals from defeating the T10 Arisen raids, and these can be used to craft a scroll to summon Great Sphinx (at 3 each) which should be pretty easy, since they drop these Seals like the Ragnarok raids drop Runes - up to 10 a raid. Each T10 raid drops a different proof, so you'll need to kill all 3, but this makes no event summon from scrolls go to waste!
○ You can also use the seals to roll an item called Eastern Regalia - a hybrid two-handed weapon that gives you bonuses for not equipping a follower. Best to use any spare runes to get a good quality one! The price for these are also 3 of each rune.
○ The Sphinx mobs are a good source of Ancient Stone! They're beasts, so they'll spawn in Beast Dens <:beast_den:948029732853805156> and Normal Dungeons <:dungeon:852209561510608956>. Farm them if you're low on that material!
